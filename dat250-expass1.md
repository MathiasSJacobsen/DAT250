# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 1
Author: Mathias Skallerud Jacobsen

## Technical problems that you encountered
Did not encounter any problems; had Java, IDE, Maven and git already installed in my device.

## Validation
I tried to run a java project with the IDE, and used the maven comand line interface to build and run it.

## Heroku
I also had Heroku installed on the device, so no technical issues in this step.
